We are developing the backend API of a revolutionary new service to ensure that you are wearing the perfect shoes for your feet.

Users of this new service can input a variety of parameters such as foot dimensions, cushion preferences, brand preferences, price range, previously liked shoes, etc.

Additional parameters may include where they live, how much walking they do, their interests, or outfit colors. 

Our service will analyze these factors and match the user with their perfect fit.

Users can also rate shoes they have previously owned in order to optimize the shoe-matching algorithm.

What's the name of this state-of-the-art web service? Solemate, of course!
