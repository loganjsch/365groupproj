We are developing the backend API of a revolutionary new service to ensure that you are wearing the perfect shoes for your feet. Users of this new service will input a variety of parameters such as foot dimensions, cushion preferences, brand preferences, price range, previously liked shoes etc... Users may even enter where they live, how much walking they do, celebrtity or styles they are into, what color pants they like to wear, and based on these factors, our service will match the user with their shoe soulmate. For example, someone who lives in North Beach San Francisco wants to be trendy, but they need shoes that will get them places. They want to fit in with their friends, but they hate the shoes they wear. Our platform, takes this all into account, and will perfectly satisfy their feet.
